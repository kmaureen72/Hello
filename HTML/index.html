    <h1>Welcome To My Kitchen</h1>
    <h2>why I love cooking</h2>
    <P>I love that cooking give me a chance to be creative and indulge my cravings. I adore losing myself in the
        rituals of chopping, stirring and <em>tasting</em>
        Love chilli (like I do)? Then add more. Love sharp, acidic flavours (like I do)? Then squeeze a lemon.

        <br>Think of it as a choose your own (tasty) adventure.
    </P>
